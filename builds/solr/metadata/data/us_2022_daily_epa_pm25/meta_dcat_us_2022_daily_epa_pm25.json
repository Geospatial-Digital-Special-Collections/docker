  "dct:description": "Each daily summary file contains data for every monitor (sampled parameter) in our database for each day. These files are separated by parameter (or parameter group) to make the sizes more manageable.\n\nThis file will contain a daily summary record that is:\n\n1) The aggregate of all sub-daily measurements taken at the monitor.\n\n2) The single sample value if the monitor takes a single, daily sample (e.g., there is only one sample with a 24-hour duration). In this case, the mean and max daily sample will have the same value.\n\nThe daily summary files contain (at least) one record for each monitor that reported data for the given day. There may be multiple records for the monitor if:\n\nThere are calculated sample durations for the pollutant. For example, PM2.5 is sometimes reported as 1-hour samples and EPA calculates 24-hour averages.\n\nThere are multiple standards for the pollutant (q.v. pollutant standards).\n\nThere were exceptional events associated with some measurements that the monitoring agency has or may request be excluded from comparison to the standard.",
  "prov:qualifiedAttribution": "direct from source\n\nFor the AQS parameter code 88101 \u2013 PM2.5 at local conditions, only report those data validated from Federal Reference Methods, Federal Equivalent Methods, or other methods that are to be used in making NAAQS decisions. For instance, Approved Regional Methods may become part of a future PM2.5 monitoring network to meet multiple monitoring objectives, including NAAQS decisions. Note: at this time only filter-based FRM and FEMs will use parameter code 88101.\n\nMore information at: https://www.epa.gov/aqs/aqs-memos-technical-note-reporting-pm25-continuous-monitoring-and-speciation-data-air-quality",
