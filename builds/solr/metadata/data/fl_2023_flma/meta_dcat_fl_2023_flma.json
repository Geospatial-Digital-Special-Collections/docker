  "dct:description": "The Florida Natural Areas Inventory is the primary source for information on Florida's conservation lands. FNAI's database includes boundaries and statistics for more than 2,900 federal, state, local, and private managed areas, all provided directly by the managing agencies. National parks, state forests, wildlife management areas, local and private preserves are examples of the managed areas included. The shapefile is called FLMA for Florida Managed Areas; updated versions are published quarterly.\n\nFLORIDA CONSERVATION LANDS (layer name FLMA): This is a polygon data layer for public (and some private) lands that the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI) has identified as having natural resource value and that are being managed at least partially for conservation purposes. The term \"Managed Area\" refers to a managed conservation land.\n",
