  "Description": "The DVMT Collection is the set of geospatial data that supports the University of Miami School of Law Environmental Justice Clinicâ€™s Displacement Vulnerability and Mitigation Tool (the Tool). The Environmental Justice Clinic created the Tool to help developers, policy makers, and community advocates assess the risks of displacement before they build and provide strategies that can be incorporated into proposed developments to mitigate displacement. The Tool is a research-based web platform that provides an instant, comprehensive analysis of data on the existing community in combination with information about the proposed development to forecast the risk of displacement and suggest appropriate mitigation methods. The DVMT Collection provides the data that powers the Tool and contains 20 geospatial data layers from publicly available sources including, for example, the US Census Bureau, Miami-Dade County, and the University of Miami Institutional Repository.
