# GDSC - Repository Front End  

This repository contains Docker container builds for the GDSC repository front end. Currently there are two implementations:

- GDSC front end (main branch)
- OHDSI front end (ohdsi branch)  

See the docker README for documentation on how to build and use.

Once built the containers can be run with either docker-compose or kubernetes. When running they provide a simple search interface at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) based on a GDSC catalog or collection(s).
