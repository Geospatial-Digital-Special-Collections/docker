# GDSC - Docker Images  

This repository contains Docker container builds for GDSC. Currently there are two implementations:

- GDSC (main branch)
- OHDSI (ohdsi branch)  

See the [README](builds/readme.md) in the builds directory for documentation on how to build and use.

Once built the containers can be run with either docker-compose or kubernetes.
